<!-- 1.The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript. -->

"Union and Intersection types are features in TypeScript that make it more powerful and flexible, especially when working with different types of data together.

1. **Union Types:**
   A Union type allows assigning multiple types to a variable or property. A union type is created using the `|` symbol.  
   **Importance:** It gives multiple options, making the code more flexible. Different types (like `string` or `number`) can be assigned to the same variable or property.

2. **Intersection Types:**
   An Intersection type allows combining two or more types together. This is used when all properties from multiple types need to be combined into one.  
   An intersection type is created using the `&` symbol.  
   **Importance:** It allows combining all properties, so features from different types can be used together. This is particularly useful when creating complex objects that need properties from multiple types."
